<h2>Questions</h2>
<hr><hr>
<h5>1. Write one procedure to prepare an electromagnet.</h5>
<h5>ANS- Electromag nets can be created by wrapping a wire around an iron nail and running current through the wire. The electric field in the wire coil creates a magnetic field around the nail. In some cases, the nail will remain magnetised even when removed from within the wire coil.</h5>
<hr>
<h5>2. What will be the effect on the magnetic field if electrical current flowing through the electric circuit is increased?</h5>
<h5>ANS- Current is directly proportional to magnetic force for a straight current carrying conductor in a uniform magnetic field. So the force is directly proportional to the size of the current. If the current is increased the force will also increase.</h5>
